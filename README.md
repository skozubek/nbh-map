## About the App

Explore the beaches of Western Crete (Greece) - inspired by the holidays spent on this wonderful Island.
It's a final project for Udacity FEND nano degree.

Application fetches the list of Western Crete beaches from Foursquare, loads their locations on the list and shows them on the map. You can select the beach you're interested in either on the list or on the map. Once selected - additional information is displayed in map's marker info window - address and image. Again - images are fetched from Foursquare.
It's possible to filter locations. Typing in "Find the beach" input box will dynamically update the list and map with filtered locations.
